# TFT_Joystick_FeatherWing_Starter_Template
A minimum code stater template to use the the Adafruit TFT Joystick FeatherWing.

So you got a Adafruit TFT Joystick FeatherWing and you just got done soldering everything up. 
Now it's time to test it out. You do a simple Hello World just to find the screen goes blank.
At this point the problem could be the code or the hardware. To help eliminate the code portion
I created this basic Template App that you can use as a project starter or simple troubleshooter.
Unlike Adafruits example this one includes DisplayIO.
